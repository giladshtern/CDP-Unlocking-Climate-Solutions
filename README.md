CDP: Unlocking Climate Solutions¶
By Gilad Shtern 27-Nov-2020
Introduction
CDP is a global non-profit that drives companies and governments to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, safeguard water resources, and protect forests. Each year, CDP takes the information supplied in its annual reporting process and scores companies and cities based on their journey through disclosure and towards environmental leadership.

CDP houses the world’s largest, most comprehensive dataset on environmental action. As the data grows to include thousands more companies and cities each year, there is increasing potential for the data to be utilized in impactful ways. Because of this potential, CDP is excited to launch an analytics challenge for the Kaggle community. Data scientists will scour environmental information provided to CDP by disclosing companies and cities, searching for solutions to our most pressing problems related to climate change, water security, deforestation, and social inequity.

How do you help cities adapt to a rapidly changing climate amidst a global pandemic, but do it in a way that is socially equitable?

What are the projects that can be invested in that will help pull cities out of a recession, mitigate climate issues, but not perpetuate racial/social inequities?

What are the practical and actionable points where city and corporate ambition join, i.e. where do cities have problems that corporations affected by those problems could solve, and vice versa?

How can we measure the intersection between environmental risks and social equity, as a contributor to resiliency?

PROBLEM STATEMENT
Develop a methodology for calculating key performance indicators (KPIs) that relate to the environmental and social issues that are discussed in the CDP survey data. Leverage external data sources and thoroughly discuss the intersection between environmental issues and social issues. Mine information to create automated insight generation demonstrating whether city and corporate ambitions take these factors into account.
